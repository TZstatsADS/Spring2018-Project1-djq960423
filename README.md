### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2018

+ Projec title: Differences in inaugural speeches between presidents from different parties
+ This project is conducted by Jiaqi Dong.

+ Project summary: In this report, I use data of all the inaugural speeches of every U.S. presidents and split them into three groups: "Democratic", "Republican" and "Others". The length of sentences in their speeches of each group is analysed. The content of the short sentences are shown. And I also inspect a overall wordcloud to see what words are often mentioned for each group.

From the result, we know that about 1/3 of the presidents from Democratic Party seems to have a perference on speaking shorter sentences while the precentage is about 1/2 in Republican Party. Most short sentences used by Democratic Party presidents are greetings and thanks, while presidents from Republican Party tends to use more short sentences to point out the problem of the country and actions he wants to take. Presidents from other parties semms rarely use sentences shorter than 3 words.

What's more, presidents from both Republican party and Democratic Party says "will" most, that means in the inaugural speech, they are telling people about their future plans and making promises. However, in the speeches of other presidents, they talk more about power, state, government, which means in their time, controling people well was the most important thing. What's more, we can also see the word "law" appears much more often in speeches of presidents of Republican party than Democratic Party, which means that Republican party's presidents seems pay more attention to legal construction.
